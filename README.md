# PROCASTIFLIP üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: TEAM ALPHA'S


### Team Members
- Team Lead: SWATHI KRISHNAN R - COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING PERUMON

### Project Description

The Procrastination Coin is a decision-making web app that flips a coin GIF to help you decide whether to actually work or procrastinate.
Spoiler: it usually says procrastinate.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes, making decisions is hard. Should you start studying? Should you clean your room? Or should you binge-watch CAT VIDEOS for 12 hours straight?
We solve this fake but important crisis.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a virtual coin flipper. It flips, it spins, it decides your fate. And because procrastination is our passion, the result is heavily biased towards ‚ÄúDo it later.‚Äù
